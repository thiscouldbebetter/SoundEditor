Sound Editor
============

The code in this repository implements a simple sound editor in JavaScript.  

To see it in action, open the file _SoundEditor.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.  A demo session file (named "JFK-We_Choose.json") is included.  Click the "Load Session" button, select the session file in the load dialog, then click the "Play Tagged Selections" button to hear an amateurishly remixed version of John F. Kennedy's "We Choose to Go to the Moon" speech.
