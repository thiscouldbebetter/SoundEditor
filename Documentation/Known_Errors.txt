Known Errors
============

- The waveform image is not being updated after a filter is applied.

- The amplify filter seems to distort the sound in some circumstances, as when using it to halve the amplitude of the float-sampled sine .wav.

- One of the sample sine waves in the Content directory, the one that uses float samples, doesn't appear to be a sine wave in the waveform view, though it does sound like one.

- The old "JFK-We_Choose" session no longer loads.

- The NEW test session file also does not load.

- Loading a second .WAV file causes an error.
